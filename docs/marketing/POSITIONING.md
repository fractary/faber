## Hero Section

### Primary Headline Options

1. **"AI That Knows When to Ask"**
   - Subhead: Autonomous AI workflows that operate independently—and escalate intelligently.

2. **"From Issue to PR, Autonomously"**
   - Subhead: AI-powered workflows that understand your code, not just your commands.

3. **"The Power of LangGraph. The Ease of n8n."**
   - Subhead: AI-native workflow automation that actually runs in production.

### Value Proposition (One-liner)

> FABER is an AI workflow platform that lets development teams automate complex tasks—from understanding an issue to shipping a PR—with AI agents that know when to proceed autonomously and when to ask for human input.

---

## Key Messages

### Message 1: Beyond Simple Automation

**Problem:** Traditional automation tools chain API calls. They can't reason about problems, adapt to unexpected situations, or make decisions.

**Solution:** FABER orchestrates AI agents that actually understand your work. They reason through problems, consider context, and make intelligent decisions—just like a senior engineer would.

**Proof Point:** A FABER workflow can take an ambiguous bug report, understand the codebase, identify the root cause, implement a fix, write tests, and open a PR—all while knowing when edge cases need human review.

---

### Message 2: Not Another Approval Machine

**Problem:** Enterprise AI tools require human approval for everything. You end up with an expensive system that generates approvals instead of output. The human becomes the bottleneck.

**Solution:** FABER uses "Earned Autonomy"—the system starts conservative and earns trust over time. 90% of work happens autonomously. Humans only get involved for the 10% that actually matters.

**Proof Point:** Mature FABER deployments achieve >90% autonomous operation with <10% human intervention—and that intervention is focused on genuinely high-risk decisions.

---

### Message 3: Guardrails Without Handcuffs

**Problem:** Raw AI agent frameworks are powerful but unpredictable. Enterprises won't adopt technology they can't trust. "Hope it works out" isn't a strategy.

**Solution:** FABER provides three layers of protection:
- **Structural Guardrails:** The FABER methodology (Frame → Architect → Build → Evaluate → Release) prevents chaos through process
- **Boundary Guardrails:** Hard limits the AI cannot cross (production deploys, cost thresholds, security configs)
- **Intelligent Guardrails:** The AI reasons about its own confidence and risk, deciding when to proceed vs. escalate

**Proof Point:** Define your risk tolerance declaratively. FABER ensures AI agents never exceed it.

---

### Message 4: Accessible Power

**Problem:** Building production AI workflows requires ML engineering expertise, LangChain knowledge, and significant infrastructure work. That's out of reach for most teams.

**Solution:** FABER makes AI workflow automation accessible through progressive disclosure:
- **Level 1:** `faber run 123` — Use defaults, get started in minutes
- **Level 2:** YAML configuration — Customize workflows without code
- **Level 3:** Python SDK — Full control when you need it

**Proof Point:** First workflow running in under 5 minutes. No ML expertise required.

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Zapier / Make / n8n

| They Say | FABER Says |
|----------|------------|
| "Automate anything" | "Automate work that requires *reasoning*" |
| "Connect your apps" | "AI agents that *understand* your work" |
| "No code required" | "No code to start, full code when needed" |
| "Trigger → Action → Result" | "Understand → Reason → Decide → Act" |

**Key Differentiator:** They chain API calls. We orchestrate AI agents.

**When to choose them:** Simple, deterministic workflows. If-this-then-that logic. API integrations.

**When to choose FABER:** Complex work that requires understanding, reasoning, and judgment. Development workflows. Tasks that currently need a human because they require thinking.

---

### vs. LangGraph / LangChain / AutoGen

| They Say | FABER Says |
|----------|------------|
| "Build any AI app" | "Build AI-powered *development workflows*" |
| "Powerful framework" | "Powerful AND accessible" |
| "For ML engineers" | "For every developer" |
| "Flexibility first" | "Production safety first" |

**Key Differentiator:** They're infrastructure. We're the product on top.

**When to choose them:** Custom AI applications. Research projects. Teams with ML engineering expertise who want full control.

**When to choose FABER:** Development workflow automation. Production deployments with enterprise requirements. Teams who want AI agents without becoming AI experts.

---

### vs. GitHub Copilot / Cursor / AI Coding Assistants

| They Say | FABER Says |
|----------|------------|
| "AI assists you" | "AI works *autonomously*" |
| "Suggestions and completions" | "End-to-end task completion" |
| "You're still in the loop" | "You're in the loop *when it matters*" |
| "Pair programming with AI" | "Delegate work to AI" |

**Key Differentiator:** Copilots assist. FABER executes.

**When to choose them:** Real-time coding assistance. Autocomplete and suggestions. Interactive pair programming.

**When to choose FABER:** Autonomous task execution. Background workflow completion. Scaling development capacity without scaling headcount.

## Use Case Messaging

### Use Case 1: Automated Bug Fixes

**Headline:** "Never triage another simple bug."

**Body:** FABER agents understand your codebase, analyze bug reports, identify root causes, implement fixes, and open PRs—autonomously. You review the PR, not the investigation.

**CTA:** "See it in action →"

---

### Use Case 2: Feature Implementation

**Headline:** "From spec to PR while you sleep."

**Body:** Hand FABER a well-defined feature specification. Wake up to a working implementation with tests, documentation, and a PR ready for review. The AI handles the routine work; you handle the design decisions.

**CTA:** "Start automating →"

---

### Use Case 3: Code Review Automation

**Headline:** "AI-powered reviews, human-quality insights."

**Body:** FABER agents review PRs against your coding standards, security requirements, and architectural patterns. They catch issues, suggest improvements, and approve straightforward changes—escalating only what needs human eyes.

**CTA:** "Upgrade your reviews →"

---

### Use Case 4: Incident Response

**Headline:** "From alert to resolution, intelligently."

**Body:** When incidents occur, FABER agents analyze logs, identify root causes, and implement fixes—or escalate to humans when the situation requires judgment. Reduce MTTR without increasing on-call burden.

**CTA:** "Automate response →"
