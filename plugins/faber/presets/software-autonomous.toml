# FABER Preset: Software Development - Autonomous
#
# This preset provides full automation with no manual approval gates.
# Workflows execute from issue to merged PR without intervention.
#
# ⚠️ WARNING: Use with caution in production environments!
#
# Use this when:
# - High confidence in FABER setup
# - Non-critical changes (docs, tests, minor fixes)
# - Internal tools or experimental projects
# - Maximum automation desired
#
# To use this preset:
#   cp presets/software-autonomous.toml .faber.config.toml
#   # Edit values marked with <...>
#   /fractary-faber:run --work-id <issue-id>
