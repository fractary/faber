# FABER Preset: Software Development - Basic
#
# This preset provides a safe, conservative configuration for software
# development workflows with manual approval gates.
#
# Use this when:
# - Getting started with FABER
# - Working on production code
# - Need approval before release
# - Prefer cautious automation
#
# To use this preset:
#   cp presets/software-basic.toml .faber.config.toml
#   # Edit values marked with <...>
#   /fractary-faber:run --work-id <issue-id>
