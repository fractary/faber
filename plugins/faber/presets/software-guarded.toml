# FABER Preset: Software Development - Guarded
#
# This preset provides balanced automation with a final approval gate
# at the Release phase. Recommended for most production workflows.
#
# Use this when:
# - Standard production workflows
# - Want automation with oversight
# - Need approval before merge
# - Trust FABER for implementation, review for release
#
# To use this preset:
#   cp presets/software-guarded.toml .faber.config.toml
#   # Edit values marked with <...>
#   /fractary-faber:run --work-id <issue-id>
