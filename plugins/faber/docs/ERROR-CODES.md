## Error Categories

### Configuration Errors (001-099)

Errors related to FABER configuration files and settings.

#### FABER-001: Configuration file not found

**Severity:** Error
**Category:** Configuration

**Description:**
The FABER configuration file `.fractary/plugins/faber/config.json` does not exist.

**Common Causes:**
- First time using FABER in this project
- Configuration file was accidentally deleted
- Working in wrong directory

**Recovery:**
```bash
/fractary-faber:config
```

**Severity:** Error
**Category:** Configuration

**Description:**
The configuration file exists but contains invalid JSON syntax.

**Common Causes:**
- Manual editing introduced syntax errors
- Corrupted file due to incomplete write
- Missing commas, brackets, or quotes

**Recovery:**
1. Validate JSON syntax using a JSON validator
2. Restore from template if errors are extensive
3. Check `.fractary/plugins/faber/backups/` for recent backups

```bash
# Validate configuration
plugins/faber/skills/core/scripts/config-validate.sh .fractary/plugins/faber/config.json

# Restore from template
cp plugins/faber/config/templates/standard.json .fractary/plugins/faber/config.json
```

---

#### FABER-003: Configuration schema validation failed

**Severity:** Error
**Category:** Configuration

**Description:**
The configuration file is valid JSON but does not conform to the FABER configuration schema.

**Common Causes:**
- Missing required fields (schema_version, workflows, integrations)
- Invalid field values (wrong type, out of range)
- Incorrect workflow or phase structure
- Invalid autonomy level

**Recovery:**
```bash
# Get detailed validation errors
plugins/faber/skills/core/scripts/config-validate.sh .fractary/plugins/faber/config.json

# Review error output and fix issues
# Reference: plugins/faber/config/config.schema.json
```

## Using Error Codes

### Reporting Errors

Use the error reporting script to display formatted error messages:

```bash
plugins/faber/skills/core/scripts/error-report.sh FABER-001
plugins/faber/skills/core/scripts/error-report.sh FABER-501 "Work item #123"
```

### Getting Recovery Suggestions

Extract recovery suggestions programmatically:

```bash
RECOVERY=$(plugins/faber/skills/core/scripts/error-recovery.sh FABER-403)
echo "$RECOVERY"
```

### In Scripts

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# Check for configuration
if [ ! -f ".fractary/plugins/faber/config.json" ]; then
    "$SCRIPT_DIR/error-report.sh" FABER-001
    exit 1
fi

# Acquire lock
if ! "$SCRIPT_DIR/lock-acquire.sh"; then
    "$SCRIPT_DIR/error-report.sh" FABER-500
    exit 1
fi
```
