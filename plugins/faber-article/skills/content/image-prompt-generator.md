# Image Prompt Generator Skill

## Purpose
Generate DALL-E 3 prompts for hero images that match Realized Self's established visual style: split composition, dramatic lighting contrasts, futuristic aesthetic with circuit patterns.

## Realized Self Visual Style Guidelines

### Core Style Elements

**1. Split Composition (Primary Pattern)**
- Left vs. Right contrast
- Before/After, Old/New, Problem/Solution dichotomies
- Central figure or transitional element
- Dramatic visual contrast between sides

**2. Lighting Scheme**
- **Warm tones**: Golden, sepia, warm orange, sunset tones
- **Cool tones**: Electric blue, cyan, blue-purple, neon
- **Contrast**: One side warm, other side cool (or both with dramatic contrast)
- **Dramatic**: High contrast, cinematic lighting

**3. Thematic Elements**
- **Technology/Digital**: Circuit patterns, holographic displays, digital streams
- **Futuristic aesthetic**: AI interfaces, glowing elements, modern tech
- **Human element**: Silhouettes, professional figures, individuals in action
- **Symbolism**: Visual metaphors for concepts (freedom, transformation, etc.)

**4. Quality Standards**
- Professional high-quality digital rendering
- Cinematic quality
- Clean, polished aesthetic
- **NO TEXT** in image (always specify "no text")

## Prompt Construction Formula

### Standard Split Composition Pattern

```
[Composition type]: [Left side description with warm lighting details], versus [right side description with cool lighting details]. [Central element or transition]. [Lighting specifics]. [Style qualifiers], [quality markers], no text.
```

### Template Structure

```
Split composition digital art: left side shows [traditional/old/problem concept] in [warm golden/sepia/orange] tones with [relevant details], right side shows [modern/new/solution concept] with [futuristic elements] in [electric blue/cyan/blue-purple] light. [Central figure or transitional element doing/representing X]. Dramatic lighting with [specific warm tone] on left, [specific cool tone] on right. Circuit patterns, professional high-quality digital rendering, cinematic, no text.
```

## Prompt Generation Process

### 1. Analyze Post Content

**Extract:**
- Main topic/theme
- Key concepts and contrasts
- Problem vs. Solution dynamic
- Target audience context
- Tone (empowering, practical, etc.)

### 2. Identify Visual Metaphor

**Questions:**
- What's the core transformation or contrast?
- What visual represents the "before" state?
- What visual represents the "after" state?
- What symbols reinforce the concept?

### 3. Map to Color Temperature

**Warm Side (Golden/Sepia/Orange):**
- Traditional, old, constrained, problem
- Past, manual, inefficient
- Corporate, institutional, limiting

**Cool Side (Blue/Cyan/Purple):**
- Modern, new, liberated, solution
- Future, automated, efficient
- Independent, digital, empowering

### 4. Add Realized Self Elements

**Always Include:**
- Circuit patterns or digital elements
- Futuristic aesthetic
- Professional quality rendering
- "no text" specification

**Optional:**
- Silhouettes or professional figures
- Holographic displays
- AI-related visual cues
- Motion or dynamic elements

### 5. Construct Prompt

**Structure:**
1. Composition type and left side (75-100 words)
2. Right side with contrast (75-100 words)
3. Central element or figure (20-40 words)
4. Lighting details (20-30 words)
5. Style qualifiers (15-25 words)
6. "no text" (always)

**Total:** ~200-290 words (DALL-E 3 accepts up to 4000 characters)

## Error Handling

### Vague Topic
- **Symptom**: Post theme unclear or too abstract
- **Action**: Request clarification or extract from post content
- **Output**: Generate prompt with best interpretation, note uncertainty

### No Clear Contrast
- **Symptom**: Topic doesn't have obvious before/after dichotomy
- **Action**: Create aspirational vs. current state contrast
- **Output**: Problem state vs. ideal state with AI/tools

### Overused Visual Metaphor
- **Symptom**: Prompt too similar to existing images
- **Action**: Brainstorm alternative angles on same theme
- **Output**: Fresh take with different visual elements

### Too Abstract
- **Symptom**: Concept doesn't translate to concrete visuals
- **Action**: Find tangible symbols or analogies
- **Output**: Concrete visual representations of abstract ideas

✅ Describe both sides in equal detail

### Don't
❌ Use abstract or vague descriptions
❌ Forget to specify "no text"
❌ Skip lighting details
❌ Create subtle or weak contrasts
❌ Use clichéd business imagery without twist
❌ Overload prompt with too many elements
❌ Forget circuit patterns/futuristic aesthetic
❌ Describe only one side in detail
